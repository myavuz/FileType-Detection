detect.erl is a module detects mime types of files using database which includes magic entries.We have used /usr/share/file/magic.mime which Ubuntu 2.6.35 also uses as database. It works in the same way with 'file' command in unix except some little differences. detects.erl parses valid lines in a magic database and uses them to check mime type of a file. While parsing, rules explained in man magic(5) are considered. detect.erl parses lines in a magic file regardless of pure valid syntax of a magic file.It tries to parses valid lines if finds, whereas file command halts process when there is a wrong line in a magic file.(It may will be changed in detect.erl). 

A valid magic line consists of four column which are Offset, Type, Data, Result respectively
(This four name used as variable name for a magic line).
e.g
0	string		%PDF-		application/pdf

Not all types are implemented in detect.erl.
Only byte,short,leshort,beshort,long,lelong,belong which are widely used in magic entries are implemented.

Up level testing is implemented. (>>0	string		%PDF-		application/pdf)

Types which may take additional parts like string/[Bbc]* , lelong&0x325ade4f  are implemented.(Details are in man magic(5))

Head operators for data like >0x335a , !%PDF- , &0x5e3d8af2 , ^0x5e3d8af2  are implemented.

Indirect Offsets which are not used in "/usr/share/file/magic.mime" are not implemented.

After parsing a magic line takes form below:
{ {Offset , TestLevel}  , Type , {HeadOperator , Data} , Result }


If Type is string it is in the form  {string , Additional arguments(/B,/b,/bc...)
If Type is numeric type  it will be  {Type, AndValue, Endiannes , Size of Type}
AndValue is value after ampersand.For belong&0xfa5e9d2a it is 0xfa5e9d2a. If type has not this part AndValue will be 'novalue' .
